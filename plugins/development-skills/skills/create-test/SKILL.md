# Create Test — Intelligent Test Design

ultrathink

**Announce:** "Using the create-test skill. Analyzing code to design tests that find bugs, not just exist."

## Rules (apply to ALL modes)

- **Simplicity first.** Use the simplest approach that catches the bug. Plain pytest + assert before any library. Add a dependency only when the concept cannot be expressed without it.
- **Tests must find bugs, not just exist.** Every test must target a specific failure mode.
- **Test through the public API.** Do not test private/internal functions directly.
- **Strong assertions only.** Never generate `assertNotNull(x)` as sole assertion. Assert specific values, shapes, invariants.
- **Random data over fixed data.** Prefer property-based tests over hardcoded cases. Fixed cases only for boundary values.
- **Fast by default.** Property tests: 100 examples. Parametrize, don't duplicate.
- **Run every test you write.** Never present tests as done without executing them.
- **Never modify source code.** Only create/modify test files, conftest, and fixtures.
- **Match project conventions.** Use existing test directory, naming, markers, fixture patterns.

## Argument Routing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **No arguments** → **Mode A: Strategic Analysis** of the full project
2. **Arguments resolve to existing file(s) or directory** → **Mode B: Targeted Generation** for those paths
3. **Arguments are natural language** (not a valid path) → **Mode A: Strategic Analysis** with `$ARGUMENTS` as the goal. Analysis and recommendations are directed toward achieving that goal.

To distinguish case 2 from 3: use Glob/Bash to check if `$ARGUMENTS` matches existing paths. If yes → Mode B. If no → Mode A with goal.

---

## Mode A: Strategic Analysis

Read `references/explorer-prompt.md`. Spawn an analysis subagent (Agent tool) with its contents as the prompt.

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a goal (case 3 above), append to the subagent prompt:

```
## USER GOAL
"$ARGUMENTS"
Focus your analysis and recommendations on what is most relevant to this goal.
Prioritize strategies that directly serve this objective.
Explain WHY each recommendation helps achieve the goal.
```

After the subagent returns, display the full analysis inline to the user.

The user will either:
- Select items by number or priority level → run **Mode B** for each selected item
- Ask a follow-up question → answer using the analysis context
- Say "skip" → end

---

## Mode B: Targeted Generation

Read `references/testing-strategies.md` now. Keep its principles active throughout.

### Step 0: Verify Test Infrastructure

1. Identify project language from config files (pyproject.toml, package.json, pom.xml, build.gradle, Package.swift)
2. Check test framework is installed and configured:
   - Python: pytest in requirements/pyproject.toml, `tests/` or `test/` directory
   - TypeScript: vitest/jest in package.json, test script defined
   - Java: JUnit in pom.xml/build.gradle, `src/test/` exists
   - Swift: XCTest/swift-testing target in Package.swift
3. If test framework **missing**: stop and ask — "No test framework detected. Should I set up [pytest/vitest/JUnit] first?"
4. If test directory **missing**: create it following language conventions

### Step 1: Read and Understand

1. Read the target file completely
2. If a directory, read all source files in it
3. Read the **relevant language section** from `references/language-templates.md` (Python, Java, TypeScript, or Swift — not the entire file)

### Step 2: Implementation Analysis

For each public function/method/endpoint:

**Boundaries:** numeric comparisons → extract thresholds, test N-1/N/N+1. String length limits, array sizes, enum ranges. Type coercion points (int/float, null).

**State space:** if/else chains, switch/match, state machines. Focus on fragile states: error paths, fallbacks, retry, timeout. Which states are NOT reachable from current tests?

**Invariants:** round-trip, idempotence, monotonicity, ordering preservation. Can a simpler reference implementation verify the result? Do aggregation totals match?

**API surface** (endpoints): request/response schemas, status code branches, CRUD lifecycle, error formats.

### Step 3: Strategy Selection

Refer to `references/testing-strategies.md` strategy matrix to select strategies.

If the target involves **refactoring**, also read `references/refactoring-workflow.md`.
If the target involves **regression detection infrastructure**, also read `references/regression-detection.md`.

| Code characteristic | Primary strategy | Secondary | Reference |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| Numeric thresholds | Boundary stress | Property-based | testing-strategies.md §1 |
| Data transformation | Property-based (round-trip, invariant) | Boundary | testing-strategies.md §2 |
| Parser / serializer | Fuzz + property-based | Boundary | testing-strategies.md §2 |
| API endpoint (read) | Golden fixture regression | Boundary | testing-strategies.md §4 |
| API endpoint (write) | CRUD lifecycle | Golden fixture | testing-strategies.md §5 |
| State machine | State transition coverage | Boundary | testing-strategies.md §1 |
| Algorithm / computation | Invariant (reference impl) | Property-based | testing-strategies.md §3 |
| Pure function, few params | Boundary exhaustive | — | testing-strategies.md §1 |
| DB queries / repositories | Real DB integration | Factory fixtures | integration-patterns.md |
| Browser UI / user flows | Playwright E2E | Visual regression | e2e-browser-patterns.md |
| Legacy code, pre-refactoring | Characterization (golden master) | Approval test | refactoring-workflow.md |
| Concurrent / async operations | Concurrency stress | Property-based | testing-strategies.md §10 |
| Microservice boundary | Contract test (Pact) | CRUD lifecycle | testing-strategies.md §11 |
| DB migrations | Up/down verification | Rollback test | integration-patterns.md |
| Migration legacy to new | Live comparison | Characterization | testing-strategies.md §6 |

### Step 4: Generate Tests

Generate the test file. For each test function:

1. **Descriptive name** — describes behavior, not method name
2. **AAA structure** — Arrange, Act, Assert (clearly separated)
3. **Strong assertions** — specific values, check `references/weak-assertion-patterns.md`
4. **Boundary tests** — N-1, N, N+1 at every threshold
5. **Property-based tests** — for data transformations (hypothesis, jqwik, fast-check)
6. **Random stress tests** — for complex logic, verify invariants over many iterations
7. **Error path tests** — invalid inputs, null/empty, type mismatches

For golden fixture / e2e patterns, generate BOTH the capture script and the regression test.

**Apply reference patterns by type:**
- DB integration → `references/integration-patterns.md`
- Playwright E2E → `references/e2e-browser-patterns.md`
- Characterization → `references/refactoring-workflow.md`
- Concurrency → `references/testing-strategies.md` §10 + `references/language-templates.md`
- Contract → `references/language-templates.md` Pact scaffolds

### Step 5: Run and Verify

1. Run generated tests with project's test command
2. Read output completely
3. If tests fail: fix the TEST (not source code), re-run
4. **Mutation check** — for each critical assertion:
   - Temporarily change expected value to something wrong
   - Run test — confirm it FAILS
   - Restore correct assertion
   - If test passes with wrong value → assertion is tautological, rewrite it

### Step 6: Quality Report

```
## Test Generation Report: [target]

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Tests generated | N | — | — |
| Assertion density | X/test | >= 2 | OK/WARN |
| Boundary tests | N | >= 1 per threshold | OK/WARN |
| Property-based tests | N | >= 1 per transform | OK/WARN |
| Weak assertions | N | 0 | OK/WARN |
| Random/fuzz tests | N | >= 1 for complex logic | OK/WARN |
| Integration tests (real DB) | N | >= 1 per repository/query | OK/WARN/N/A |
| E2E browser tests | N | >= 1 per critical flow | OK/WARN/N/A |
| Characterization tests | N | >= 1 per legacy module | OK/WARN/N/A |
| Concurrency tests | N | >= 1 per shared resource | OK/WARN/N/A |
