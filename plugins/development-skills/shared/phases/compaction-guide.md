# Context Compaction Guide

When the system auto-compresses prior messages, this defines what MUST be preserved vs what can be safely dropped.

## MUST PRESERVE (loss = workflow failure)

1. **Current phase number and name** — E.g., "Currently in Phase 5 (Verify)"
2. **Plan file path** — `docs/plans/NNNN__*.md` — this is the **single recovery point**. Reading this file recovers everything.
3. **Language skill in use** — Which language skill is active
4. **User's original task description** — The WHY behind the work

Everything else is on disk.

## SAFE TO DROP (all recoverable from plan file on disk)

| Information | Where on disk |
|---|---|
| Research findings | Plan file → `Research:` field → research file |
| User clarification Q&A | Plan file → `## Clarifications` |
| Plan details | Plan file body |
| Implementation reasoning | Plan file → `## Implementation Log` |
| Task progress + affected files | Plan file → `## Task Checklist` |
| Verification iteration details | Plan file → `## Verification Results` |
| Review feedback + audit trail | Plan file → `## Review Log` |
| Chronicle content | Plan file → `Chronicle:` field → chronicle file |
| Code file contents | Source files on disk |

## RECOVERY PROTOCOL

1. **Read the plan file** — WORKFLOW STATE has current phase, remaining phases, all file paths
2. **Read the language skill's configuration** — Verification commands, implementation rules
3. **Re-read workflow.md** if the workflow rules themselves were dropped
4. Read the current phase file from `phases/` for detailed instructions
