A Claude Code plugin that enforces a structured development workflow: 7-phase quality gates, specialized subagents, and multi-language support.

Without structure, Claude Code skips verification, doesn't plan, writes before thinking, and never reviews its own work. This plugin enforces a 7-phase workflow with specialized subagents — brainstorming analyst, TDD implementer, test verifier, and staff-engineer reviewer — running in isolated contexts so your main conversation stays clean.

Built from months of production use, grounded in the [official Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and distilled knowledge from projects like [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers), [claude-code-tips](https://github.com/ykdojo/claude-code-tips), and [Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering](https://github.com/muratcankoylan/Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering). Every rule exists because we hit the failure mode it prevents.

## Quick Start

```bash
/plugin marketplace add reidemeister94/development-skills
/plugin install development-skills@development-skills-marketplace
```

Give Claude a task — the plugin activates automatically.

## Core Pillars

These aren't aspirational — they're enforced at every decision point in the workflow.

**Critical thinking is always on.** The model evaluates every request for flaws, contradictions, wrong assumptions, and symptom-vs-root-cause confusion. If something doesn't add up, it stops and says so.

**Maximize simplicity, minimize complexity.** All else being equal, simpler is better. A small improvement that adds ugly complexity is not worth it. The staff reviewer's primary mandate is simplification.

**All signal, zero noise.** Code, docs, logs, comments — everything must earn its place. Comments explain WHY, not WHAT. Don't comment self-evident code. Don't add features nobody asked for.

**Offload everything to disk.** Context windows are ephemeral — compaction erases discoveries. The plugin persists knowledge to structured markdown files:
- **Plans** (`docs/plans/`) — task checklist, implementation log, verification results, review audit trail.
- **Chronicles** (`docs/chronicles/`) — project snapshots capturing WHY changes happened, decisions made, discoveries.
- **CLAUDE.md** — project-wide knowledge promoted from discoveries. A cheat sheet, not a novel.

**Maximize final code quality.** TDD discipline (RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR), anti-hallucination verification, and independent staff review at every phase.

**Efficient context usage.** Progressive disclosure loads only what's needed. Subagents run in isolated contexts — their token usage doesn't bloat your conversation.

## The 7-Phase Workflow

Every task goes through gated phases. No skipping, no shortcuts.

| # | Phase | Gate |
|---|-------|------|
| 1 | **Research** — codebase + web research in isolated subagent | `RESEARCH COMPLETE` |
| 2 | **Plan** — persisted to disk, requires your approval | User approves |
| 3 | **Chronicle** — captures the WHY behind changes | `CHRONICLE INITIATED` |
| 4 | **Implement** — single subagent, TDD cycles, progress on disk | `SOLUTION COMPLETE` |
| 5 | **Verify** — test/build/lint via subagent, evidence required | `VERIFICATION COMPLETE` |
| 6 | **Staff Review** — spec compliance + code quality, iterate until approved | `STAFF REVIEW: APPROVED` |
| 7 | **Finalize** — chronicle, docs alignment, CLAUDE.md updates | `WORKFLOW COMPLETE` |

**Lightweight mode** kicks in for small tasks (<=3 files, single approach, reversible) — same gates, less ceremony. Skips brainstorming and research subagents, saving tokens and reducing cost.

---

## Brainstorming Guard

Before any code is written, every request is evaluated:

- **Scope** — More than 3 files?
- **Reversibility** — Undoable in under 1 hour?
- **Approaches** — Only one obvious way?
- **Motivation** — Does the request state WHY?

If the task is large, hard to reverse, or has multiple valid approaches, brainstorming runs in an isolated subagent: web research, codebase exploration, approach scoring, plan written to disk.

Includes a **first-principles challenge** — if the developer is solving the wrong problem, the model stops and says so.

**Default: invoke brainstorming.** The burden of proof is on skipping.

---

## Subagents

Token-isolated — their work doesn't bloat your conversation:

| Agent | Model | Job |
|-------|-------|-----|
| **implementer** | Opus | All tasks in one session. TDD discipline, anti-hallucination checks, progress on disk. |
| **staff-reviewer** | Opus | Two-stage review: spec compliance, then code quality. Primary mandate: simplification. |
| **test-verifier** | Sonnet | Runs build/test/lint. Returns pass/fail summary. Verbose output stays in its context. |

---

## Anti-Rationalization

Tables at every decision point catch the model rationalizing shortcuts:

| Model thinks... | Reality |
|---|---|
| *"Simple enough to skip planning"* | Simple-looking changes cause the hardest bugs. |
| *"The user said exactly what to do"* | Knowing WHAT doesn't mean there's only one HOW. |
| *"I can review my own code"* | Self-review is not independent evaluation. |
| *"The developer seems confident"* | Confidence is not correctness. Evaluate reasoning, not tone. |

## Language Support

Each language skill provides verification commands, implementation rules, a `patterns.md` with code examples and anti-patterns, and a quality checklist.

| Language | Skill | Patterns |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Python | `python-dev` | Pydantic, FastAPI, asyncpg, DI via lifespan, pytest |
| Java | `java-dev` | Records, Streams, Spring Boot, constructor injection |
| TypeScript | `typescript-dev` | Zod, strict mode, ESM, Result types |
| Swift | `swift-dev` | SwiftUI, async/await, actors, Codable, SPM |
| Frontend | `frontend-dev` | Auto-detects: React, Next.js, Raycast, Vite |

## How It Works

**Progressive disclosure** — minimal context overhead:
- **L1 (always loaded):** `workflow.md` — phase sequence, gates, anti-rationalization (~70 lines)
- **L2 (on-demand):** `phases/phase-N-*.md` — detailed instructions loaded just-in-time (~300 words each)

**State persistence** — survives context compaction:
- WORKFLOW STATE block at top of plan file
- Plan file on disk with status + remaining phases
- Auto-resume: `core-dev` checks for in-progress plans first

**Three layers of knowledge:**
```
Code + Git  = WHAT changed
Plan docs   = HOW it was implemented
Chronicles  = WHY it happened + full project context
```

## Contributing

Contributions welcome. The key constraint: **every change must align with the [6 behavior principles](CLAUDE.md)**. If a change would make the model more accommodating, weaken critical evaluation, or reduce planning rigor — it doesn't belong here.
